description: "Katerina received her PhD in Genetics from Churchill College at Cambridge University. After completing her PhD, she joined the Wellcome Sanger Institute as a Postdoctoral Fellow, where she worked on a variety of projects exploring the utility of large DNA sequencing studies (S:CORT Consortium, PDX Finder) to predict clinical outcomes for cancer patients and shed light on tumor evolution of different cancers (Draaisma, Chatzipli et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2019). Her work also involved modeling chromosomal catastrophes (e.g., chromothripsis) often seen in cancer, and unraveling of their mechanisms (Maciejowski, Chatzipli, et al., Nature Genetics, 2020). Apart from research, Katerina also enjoyed teaching Cell Biology modules to undergraduate Natural Sciences students as part of her Fitzwilliam College Bye-Fellowship at Cambridge University.In the Park Lab, Katerina works on genome-scale sequencing data to generate insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer and rare human diseases as part of the GeM Consortium and Undiagnosed Diseases Network."
