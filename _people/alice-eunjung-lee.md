description: "Alice is a Principal Investigator in the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) and an Assistan Professor at Harvard Medical School (HMS). She is also an associte member of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. She obtained her PhD in Bioinformatics from KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) in 2008. She served as a postdoctoral fellow in Peter Park’s laboratory at HMS and Brigham and Women's Hospital starting in 2010 and became an Instructor in 2013.During her postdoctoral training, she had extensive experience in studying somatic mutation in human cancer and in single neuronal genomes through participating in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), an NIH-led cancer genomics consortium and other projects. She has developed computational methods for whole-genome sequencing data analysis including theTea(Transposable Element Analyzer) method (Lee et al., Science, 2012) and performed a systematic analysis of mobilization of all retrotransposon classes in human cancer. TheTeamethod has been successfully applied to multiple genomic studies in different contexts including human cancer, single-neuron analysis, and primate evolution. Most recently, she has identified numerous somatic single nucleotide variants, including synonymous ones, that disrupt mRNA splicing in cancer through an integrative analysis of large-scale DNA- and RNA-sequencing data and found that intron retention is a common yet underappreciated mechanism of tumor suppressor inactivation in cancer (Jung et al., Nature Genetics, 2015).She joined the faculty of the Division of Genetics and Genomics at BCH and HMS in 2017 and runs a research program that studies somatic mutation and repetitive DNA such as transposable elements in human diseases using cutting-edge genomic technologies, envisioning the translation of her scientific discoveries into improved healthcare outcomes."
