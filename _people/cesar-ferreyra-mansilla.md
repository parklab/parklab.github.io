description: "I received a BA in Information Science at Cornell University. During my time there, I worked as a Software Developer for the university newspaper organization, the Cornell Daily Sun, where I built interactive web pages for news articles. Afterwards, I worked as a software developer at a digital agency based out of New York City, where I built websites and portals for healthcare startups. Outside of programming I like running, cooking, and admiring my indoor plants."
