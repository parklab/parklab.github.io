description: "My name is Daniel and I am a G1 in BIG. I graduated from Yale in 2020 with a degree in Statistics and Data Science. While at Yale, I worked in the Joe Howard lab where I applied Bayesian inference and MCMC algorithms to study neural dendrite morphogenesis in fruit flies. Following Yale, I took on a role as an associate computational biologist at the Broad Institute, where I worked on genomic and transcriptomic privacy in the Hoon Cho lab. Currently, I am interested in functional genomics, epigenomics, and 3D chromatin organization. I am looking forward to my rotation in the Park Lab!"
