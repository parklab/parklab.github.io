description: "Michele is currently working as part of the 4DNuclome Data Coordination and Integration Center, focusing on the development and implementation of automated pipelines and genomic workflows in the Amazon Cloud environment.He completed is Ph.D. in 2019 at University of Padova where he worked on the development of software and databases to investigate the secondary structures that form in nucleic acids. As a result he developed and implemented two novel algorithms (nessie and QPARSE) to detect degenerate sequence motifs that are involved in the formation of some classes of non-canonical structures in nucleic acids. He alsoÂ contributed to the development of a web-database that provides a comprehensive evaluation of G-quadruplex structures in human viruses."
