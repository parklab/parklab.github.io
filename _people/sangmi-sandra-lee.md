description: "Sangmi Lee received her PhD from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, South Korea. During her doctoral studies, her research focused on the development and application of systems biology approaches for the discovery of cancer biomarkers and drug targets tailored to personalized cancer treatment. She developed computational methods to elucidate altered cancer metabolism associated with somatic mutations and identify metabolism-based drug targets for high-risk cancer patients, employing network modeling, statistics, and artificial intelligence. Currently, as a postdoctoral fellow in the Park lab, she is broadening her research focus towards the genomic underpinnings of cancer, with a particular emphasis on circulating tumor DNA, leveraging her extensive expertise in bioinformatics, computational modeling, optimization techniques, and machine learning."
