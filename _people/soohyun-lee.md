description: "Soo Lee received her Ph.D. in bioinformatics from Boston University in 2009. (Ph.D advisors :Zhiping Weng, Simon Kasif, Charles Cantor). She is currently working as part of the 4DNucleome Data Coordination and Integration Center, setting up automated genomic workflows on the Amazon Cloud using Docker, Common Workflow Language (CWL) and Workflow Description Language (WDL). She is a main developer of Tibanna, a workflow manager for AWS cloud. She also wrote Pairix, a fast random access tool for 2D genomic positions.Previously, she developed EMSAR, a software program for quantifying mRNA transcripts from RNA-seq data. She also participated in the study of transcriptomics in various biological contexts such as comparison of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, detecting translation initiation sites genomewide, or analysis of mutation rates in single neurons. Earlier, she developed software tools for analyzing high throughput-sequencing of small RNAs for the studies of siRNAs and piRNAs in fruit fly (2008-2009), in collaboration with Phil Zamore at UMMS.GitHub Reposhttps://github.com/4dn-dcic/tibannahttps://github.com/4dn-dcic/pairixhttps://github.com/4dn-dcic/Rpairixhttps://github.com/4dn-dcic/docker-4dn-hichttps://github.com/parklab/emsarPublicationshttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kvNet-8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"
