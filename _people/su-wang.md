description: "Su received her PhD in the end of 2015 from Tongji University under the supervison of Dr. Xiaole Shirley Liu.She is interested in developing cutting-edge computational approaches that utilize large amount of high-throughput data and use these computational approaches to resolve questions in biology. Via using statistical methods combines with biological meaningful algorithms, she built two models to understand the gene expression from the view of transcription regulation(BETA:http://cistrome.org/BETA/) and epigenetic regulation(MARGE:http://cistrome.org/MARGE/).currently, she is working in the 4D Nucleome program, and trying to explore the role nuclear organization plays in gene expression, and how changes in the nuclear organization affect normal development as well as various diseases."
