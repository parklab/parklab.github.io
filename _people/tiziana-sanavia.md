description: "Tiziana Sanavia was born in Dolo (Venice, Italy) on April 26th, 1984. She got a Bachelor Degree in Information technologies engineering at University of Padova in 2006, with a thesis in compartmental models, identification and parameter estimation, and a Master Degree in Bioengineering with summa cum laude at University of Padova in 2008, presenting the thesis \"Function-based discovery of temporal gene expression patterns in endothelial cells stimulated with insulin\". From 2009 and 2011 she attended the Ph.D. School on Information Engineering (Bioengineering) at University of Padova, achieving the PhD Degree in 2012 disserting the thesis \"Biomarker lists stability in genomic studies: analysis and improvement by prior biological knowledge integration into the learning process\". From January 2012 to March 2016 she was a post-doctoral fellow at the Department of Information Engineering at University of Padova and her research activity was focused on the integration of biological information in the analysis of high-throughput microarray and sequencing data. From April 2012 to March 2013 she was a visiting scholar at Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory (prof. Christian J. Stoeckert Lab), Perelman School of Medicine at University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, USA), acquiring new expertise in sequencing data analysis (RNA-seq for gene expression, bisulfite sequencing and Chip-seq for epigenomic data) and focusing on studies of cellular development and differentiation of pancreatic cells. In 2014 she won a 2-year funding for a senior postdoctoral fellowship from the University of Padova with the research project “Integrative epigenomic and genomic computational methods for high-throughput sequencing data”. She is author/coauthor of 10 full papers on international peer reviewed journals and more than 20 scientific communications at international and national conferences. During her research activity, she achieved different honors and awards: study abroad scholarship awarded by \"Fondazione Aldo Gini\" in 2013; honourable mention for best performer (fourth place) in Systems Genetics Challenge (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) at Columbia University (USA) in 2010; national award for best Master thesis in Bioengineering in 2008. Currently she is working at Park Lab as a Research Fellow in projects focusing on the analysis of whole-genome/exome sequencing datasets from cancer and neurological diseases, using high-throughput sequencing technology."
