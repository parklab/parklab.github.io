description: "My name is Wafa and I am a G1 in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences program at Harvard Medical School. I graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 2019 with a Bachelor’s in Biochemistry. While at MHC, I worked in Dr. Craig Woodard’s lab where I employed classical genetic techniques to understand the regulatory pathways involved in the developmental processes in Drosophila melanogaster. After MHC, I took on a role as a Research Technician in Dr. Aaron Hata’s lab at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. In the Hata lab, I studied the mechanisms of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used in the treatment of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) driven Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Currently, I am exploring mechanisms of tumorigenesis, cancer metastasis, and acquired resistance to leverage this knowledge towards the development of targeted cancer therapies. When not in the lab I enjoy being outdoors playing sports and enjoying nature."
