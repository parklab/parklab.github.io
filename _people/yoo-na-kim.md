Following that, I pursued Medicine at Yonsei University College of Medicine, where I completed my internship and residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yonsei University’s Severance Hospital in South Korea.After completing my residency, I worked as a biomedical analyst in 2020 at UCL/EUTOPS, focusing on epigenetics research using microarray data from various types of gynecological cancer samples, including cervical swabs, buccal swabs, and whole blood. Subsequently, I returned to my clinical role as a fellow in Gynecologic Oncology at Severance Hospital. During my fellowship, I actively participated in running clinical trials and analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data from gynecological cancer samples, including circulating tumor DNA samples."
