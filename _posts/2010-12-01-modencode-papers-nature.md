The modENCODE papers are out! Congrats to Peter Khachenko and the team for the chromatin paper in Nature and the integrative paper in Science. For additional information, see the press release from NIH, Genome 'census' reveals hidden riches at NatureNews and Early Reports From the 'Dark Matter' of the Genome from wired.com. The figure on the right shows a snapshot from the chromatin state browser that Richard Park in the group implemented.
