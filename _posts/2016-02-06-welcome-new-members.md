Isidro Cortes and Max Sherman joined the lab in January. Isidro comes from Institut Pasteur in Paris, where he applied machine learning methods to modeling of biochemical compounds. Max comes after finishing his master's degree in statistics at the University of Cambridge and a brief stint in NYC. Also, a belated welcome to Scott Ouellette, who joined us in September as a scientific programmer.
