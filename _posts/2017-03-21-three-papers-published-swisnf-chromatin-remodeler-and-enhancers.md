See the [news release](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/agent-mischief) from Harvard Medical School and the [news article](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161212115812.html) on ScienceDaily.  

In collaboration with the Roberts laboratory, we have published three complementary papers in Nature Genetics ([Wang X et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.3746), [Mathur R et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.3744)) and Nature Communications ([Alver BH et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14648)). We have been working with Charlie Roberts lab for some time now; Charlie was previously at the Dana-Farber Cancer Center; he is now the director of the Cancer Center at St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis.

SWI/SNF is a chromatin remodeling protein complex that is mutated in >20% of all cancers. In these three manuscripts, we studied six different cell types, including both normal and cancer cells, with or without the presence of different SWI/SNF subunits. A consistent picture that emerged in all these studies is that the predominant function of the SWI/SNF complex is maintaining developmental enhancers. The papers demonstrate that loss of SWI/SNF subunits in normal cells leads specifically to inactivation of enhancers ([Alver BH et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14648)) and that the SWI/SNF independent super-enhancers pose targetable vulnerabilities of SWI/SNF mutant cancers ([Wang X et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.3746)). We also show that loss of the ARID1A subunit in mice leads invasive adenocarcinomas resembling human colorectal cancer, via a mechanism that is distinct from the highly studied APC/Î²-catenin models ([Mathur R et al](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v49/n2/full/ng.3744.html)).

Congratulations to Burak who led the bioinformatic analysis in all three papers!
