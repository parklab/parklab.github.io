We are excited to announce the addition of new members to our lab this month and next month!

Welcome to our two new postdocs, [Chong (Simon) Chu](/people/simon-chong-chu) and [Yanmei Dou](/people/yanmei-dou), who will be arriving in the next coming weeks. Simon earned his PhD in computer science and engineering at the University of Connecticut and Yanmei earned her PhD in bioinformatics at Peking University in China. 

We also have several students who have joined the lab. [Heather Gold](/people/heather-gold), a PhD candidate of the BIG program, has decided to join the lab after doing her rotation last semester. [Vinay Viswanadham](/people/vinay-viswanadham), also a PhD candidate of the BIG program, will be doing research as a rotation student in our lab. [Connor Horton](/people/connor-horton) is an undergraduate student at Harvard College who will be conducting research on single-cell Hi-C for his senior thesis and as part of the 4D Nucleome Project. Yixuan He, Danielle Rubin, and Rebecca Panitch are undergraduate students who are part of the DBMI Summer Institute in Biomedical Informatics. They will be conducting various research studies under the supervision of our postdocs and programmers. 

Finally, Alon Galor will be joining us in July as a Jr. Scientific Programmer. 

Welcome everyone!
