Congratulations to Craig Bohrson, Alison Barton, and Daniel Kwon, three of the six co-lead authors of a recently published paper in Science, discussing the increased accumulation of mutations in neurons as people age. The paper was the result of a collaborative effort with the Walsh Lab of Boston Children's Hospital. The link to the paper is [here](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/12/06/science.aao4426); the paper was featured in multiple news outlets:

- [Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171207141638.htm): Mutations in neurons accumulate as we age; may explain normal cognitive decline and neurodegeneration
- [Vector - Boston Children's Hospital](https://vector.childrenshospital.org/2017/12/age-related-neuronal-mutations-genosenium/): Mutations accumulate in our brain cells as we age. Do they explain cognitive loss?
