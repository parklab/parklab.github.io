We are excited to announce the addition of new members to our lab during the past couple of months.

A belated welcome to our newest Postdoc, [Jinkuk Kim](/people/jinkuk-kim) who joined us back in October of 2017. Jinkuk earned his PhD in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics at MIT and worked as a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist at Deep Genomics in Toronto, Canada before joining us.

We would also like to welcome [Sarah Reiff](/people/sarah-reiff), who joined us earlier this month. Sarah earned her PhD in Cellular Biology from the University of Georgia and did her postdoc at UCSF before joining our lab. She will be working as a Data Curator for the 4DN DCIC team. 

Welcome Sarah and Jinkuk! We are lucky to have you both join us!
