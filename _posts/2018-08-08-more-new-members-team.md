In the last few months, we had additional members joining our team! We'd like to welcome Hu Jin, Shannon Ehmsen, and Luisa Mercado!

Hu is a postdoc who joined us back in July. He received his PhD in Physics from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. In the park lab, he is working on development and application of computational methods for integration of three-dimensional chromosomal interaction data with DNA mutation data. Shannon is a undergraduate student at Northeastern University who is doing her co-op as a graphic designer for the 4DN team and Luisa is a recent grad from Webster University in St. Louis, MO, and has joined the 4DN team as an assistant data curator. 

Welcome everyone! We are excited to have you on our team!
