Members of the DCIC (Data Coordination and Integration Center) traveled to San Diego for the Annual Meeting of the 4D Nucleome project. From the HMS group were curators Andy, Koray, Sarah, and Luisa; postdoctoral fellows Su Wang and Hu Jin; and co-leaders Burak and Peter.  Peter gave a talk outlining the superb work that the team has been doing all year. Particularly impressive were the beautiful web interface by Alex Balashov, 4DN JupyterHub by Carl, and and publication pages by our curators.
