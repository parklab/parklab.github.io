The Park lab has been funded by Cancer Research UK’s Grand Challenge, which provides £20M over 5 years to a team to work on toughest problems in cancer research. Our team, led by our long-time collaborator Steve Elledge, includes a number of investigators from US/UK/Netherlands. We will attempt to understand why there is such tissue-specificity in cancer drivers--i.e., why one oncogene causes cancer in one tissue but does not in another.
