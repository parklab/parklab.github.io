Congratulations to Vinay for graduating this year with a PhD!  At 369 pages, his thesis “Origins, patterns, and consequences of somatic mutations in engineered, normal, and diseased cells” spans multiple areas including tracking the pattern of somatic mutations in the brain at the single cell level, identifying off-target effects of genome editing with single cell whole-genome sequencing, and finding the impact of somatic structural alterations that disrupt non-coding regions. Awesome work, Dr. Viswanadham!
