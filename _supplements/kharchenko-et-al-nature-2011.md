abstract_description: "Chromatin is composed of DNA and a variety of modified histones and non-histone proteins, which have an impact on cell differentiation, gene regulation and other key cellular processes. Here we present a genome-wide chromatin landscape for Drosophila melanogaster based on eighteen histone modifications, summarized by nine prevalent combinatorial patterns. Integrative analysis with other data (non-histone chromatin proteins, DNase I hypersensitivity, GRO-Seq reads produced by engaged polymerase, short/long RNA products) reveals discrete characteristics of chromosomes, genes, regulatory elements and other functional domains. We find that active genes display distinct chromatin signatures that are correlated with disparate gene lengths, exon patterns, regulatory functions and genomic contexts. We also demonstrate a diversity of signatures among Polycomb targets that include a subset with paused polymerase. This systematic profiling and integrative analysis of chromatin signatures provides insights into how genomic elements are regulated, and will serve as a resource for future experimental investigations of genome structure and function."

### Chromatin segmentations
Wig files showing association of different genomic regions with the identified chromatin states: [S2] [BG3]

### DNase I sensitivity
__Raw data__
Links to the fastq files: [S2] [BG3] [Kc167]

__Smoothed read density__
The wig files show DNaseI read density profiles, smoothed with a 150bp Gaussian kernel (primarily meant for visualization purposes): [S2] [BG3] [Kc167]

__DNase I hypersensitive sites__
The detected (high-magnitude) DHS positions: [S2] [BG3] [Kc167]

The tab-delimited files report the following columns:
- chromosome
- position on the chromosome
- magnitude of the DNase I peak
- maximum likelihood estimate of DNaseI reads enrichment over genomic background expectation (log2 scale)
