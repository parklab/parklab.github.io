abstract_description: "Dosage compensation equalizes the levels of transcripts encoded on the X chromosome between XY males and XX females. In Drosophila, dosage compensation requires the MSL (Male Specific Lethal) complex, which associates with actively transcribed genes on the single male X chromosome to upregulate transcription approximately two-fold. MSL complex targets genes, with increased binding toward 3’ ends. To search for chromatin modifications associated with MSL binding, we mapped H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) in Drosophila SL2 cells, and found that it marks transcribed genes with a 3’ bias, as in yeast and humans. On the male X chromosome, or when MSL complex is ectopically localized to an autosome, H3K36me3 is a strong predictor of MSL binding. We isolated mutants lacking Set2, the H3K36me3 methyltransferase, and found that Set2 is an essential gene in both sexes of Drosophila. In set2 mutant males, MSL complex can still associate with high affinity sites, which are proposed to mark the X chromosome through DNA sequence elements. Yet, MSL complex exhibits reduced binding to target genes, suggesting a specific role for H3K36me3 in MSL targeting. In addition, we found that recombinant MSL3 protein preferentially binds nucleosomes marked by H3K36me3 in vitro. Our results support a model in which the MSL complex recognizes many of its targets through general features of transcribed genes."
