<meta name="description" content="Doga received her PhD in 2016 from MIT Physics Department where she was working with the Relativistic Heavy Ion Group. Her work was focused on development of analysis software, algorithms and data analysis. She studied the properties of quark-gluon plasma, a form of matter that is created shortly after the Big Bang as well as in collisions of heavy ions at research facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. After her graduation, she continued her research on this topic as a Research Fellow at CERN.Doga joined the Park Lab in April 2017. During her time here, she has been involved in variety of projects related to cancer genomics. She focused mostly on mutational signatures, the idea behind which is to identify the factors that cause cancer from their mutational footprints. She developed a tool that allows identification of mutational signatures from low mutation counts. With this tool, the mutational signature of HR deficiency can be identified from targeted gene panels in clinical settings. With collaborators in the DFCI, she is working on demonstrating the applicability of this tool in clinical settings. She hopes that this effort will allow us to identify more patients who may benefit from targeted treatments, as many patients with HR deficiency do not have actionable mutations. In addition, she is interested in evolutionary dynamics of tumors, and the accumulation of mutations in tumors as well as in normal tissues." />
