description: "Elizabeth received her PhD in Bioinformatics from the University of British Columbia, Canada. As part of the NIH NCI’s Therapeutically Applicable Research that Generates Effective Therapy (TARGET) initiative, Elizabeth’s doctoral research focused on molecular characterization of pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) through integrative analyses of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, and genome-wide DNA methylation and histone modification profiles (Chun et al. (2016) Cancer Cell; Chun et al. (2019) Cell Reports). Elizabeth continued her research in Dr. Marco Marra’s lab as a postdoctoral research fellow, to identify genetic and epigenetic alterations in MRTs using long-read sequencing data. Prior to her graduate training, Elizabeth worked as a computational biologist at Canada’s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, performing data analyses and coordinating research activities for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Development of Highly active Anti-Leukemia stem cell Therapy project at the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM-HALT). Elizabeth joined the Park Lab in June 2022. In the Park Lab, Elizabeth is continuing her research in computational cancer genomics and contributing her work to the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem projects."
