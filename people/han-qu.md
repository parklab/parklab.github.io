description: "Han Qu earned her PhD degree under the supervision of Dr. Zhenyu Jia in the Department of Botany & Plant Sciences at the University of California, Riverside. During her doctoral studies, Hanâ€™s research was centered around the development of algorithms for cost-effective chromosome-scale haplotype inference, the introduction of a robust EM algorithm for analyzing binary data, and the design of a comprehensive phylogenomic framework for studying pomegranates. Currently, in the Park Lab, Han is focused on computational analysis of DNA sequencing data. Her work primarily involves the development and application of algorithms for detecting mosaic mutations and repetitive elements in the human genome."
