description: "Julia conducted her doctoral research at the Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine / Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology under the supervision of Prof. Roland Schwarz, in close collaboration with Prof. Ana Pombo, and earned her PhD at the Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany.Julia is interested in understanding chromatin organization in space and time and its effect on gene expression regulation through epigenetic mechanisms in development and disease.Her research is focused on haplotype-specific chromatin conformation, for which she developed bioinformatic algorithms for haplotype reconstruction and the generation of detailed haplotype-specific chromatin contact maps during her PhD.As a postdoctoral research fellow at HMS, Julia will continue her research on chromatin architecture as a member of the 4DN Program."
