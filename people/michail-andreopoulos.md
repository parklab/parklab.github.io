description: "Michail graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2023 with an MPhil in computational biology and from the University of Manchester in 2022 with a BSc in physics. During his undergraduate studies, he developed a strong interest in biophysics and conducted research on computational models aiming to explain the biomechanics of the heart and the origin of cardiac arrhythmia. As a part of his MPhil degree, he developed a computational methodology that utilized machine learning to identify data-driven patient selection criteria, with the goal of increasing the statistical power of clinical trials. He is currently an Associate Computational Biologist at the Park Lab, working on cancer genomics."
