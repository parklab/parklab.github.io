Her doctoral research focused on the dissection of quantitative trait variation in a multi-parent mapping population of maize, assessing the statistical power of various models to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL)Â  (Odell et al. (2022), G3) and the ability of gene expression QTL to explain variation in complex traits.
