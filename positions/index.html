<h4 id="updated-may-2023">[updated May 2023]</h4>

<p>Applications are invited for multiple positions in the <a href="/">Park laboratory</a> in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. The aim of the laboratory is to develop and apply innovative computational methods for genome sequencing data to enhance our understanding of cancer genetics, neurogenetics, and epigenetics.</p>

<p>Recent work from the laboratory includes methods for detection of mosaic mutations from single cell and bulk WGS data (Luquette et al, Nat Genetics, 2022; Dou et al, Nat Biotech, 2020; Bohrson et al, Nat Gen, 2019) and their applications (Bizzoto et al, Science, 2021; Lodato et al, Science, 2018), mutational signature analysis (Gurhan et al, Nat Gen, 2019), and analysis of chromothripsis events across cancers (Ciriano-Cortes et al, Nat Gen, 2020).</p>

<h4 id="new-data-analysis-center-for-the-somatic-mosaicism-across-human-tissues-smaht-project-see-here-for-more-information-about-the-project-in-addition-to-an-amazing-dataset-this-consortium-will-be-a-wonderfulopportunity-to-get-to-know-top-researchers-in-the-field">New: Data Analysis Center for the Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) project. See <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-140-million-effort-investigate-genetic-variation-normal-human-cells-tissues#.ZGPRCj3vAzl.twitter">here</a> for more information about the project. In addition to an amazing dataset, this consortium will be a wonderfulÂ opportunity to get to know top researchers in the field.</h4>

<h3 id="postdoctoral-fellows">Postdoctoral Fellows</h3>

<p>Several positions are available immediately. Areas of interest include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identification of mosaic mutations in non-tumor cells and application to lineage tracing</li>
  <li>Algorithms for characterizing structural alterations in whole-genome sequencing data</li>
  <li>Mutational signature analysis for cancer/brain samples</li>
  <li>Analysis of repetitive elements including transposable elements and tandem repeats</li>
</ul>

<p>An ideal candidate will have a PhD in computational biology/bioinformatics/statistics/CS or another quantitative field, as well as excellent programming and communication skills. Experience in analysis of high-throughput sequencing data is highly desirable. Those without bioinformatics experience but have a very strong quantitative (math/physics/stat) background will also be considered.</p>

<p>The successful candidates will join a group of supportive and productive computational biologists and have an opportunity to collaborate with world-class biologists in the Harvard medical area. Many of our fellows have gone on to faculty positions at top institutions, including three at Harvard.</p>

<p>Please send your CV with â[POSTDOC]â and your name in the subject line. A research statement that demonstrates oneâs expertise in an area is helpful but not required.</p>

<h3 id="bioinformatics-scientist">Bioinformatics Scientist</h3>

<p>We are also seeking a staff bioinformatics scientist to beÂ part ofÂ the SMaHT Data Analysis Center and other projects. This is ideal for those who love bioinformatics analysis but do not wish to be on the standard postdoc track. Postdoctoral experience is desirable but not required.</p>

<h3 id="associate-computational-biologists">Associate Computational Biologists</h3>

<p>MultipleÂ positions (formerly called Junior Scientific Programmer) are available for those who finished college and are looking for research experience before going on to graduate or medical school. They will assist postdoctoral fellows with various research projects and, if desired, engage in their own research. These are competitive positions for those who have exceled in college. A two-year commitment is required.</p>

<p>The immediate positions after leaving the lab for the recent alumni:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alison Barton (Yale; masterâs at Cambridge UK): PhD student in Bioinformatics &amp; Integrative Genomics at Harvard</li>
  <li>Max Sherman (Brown; masterâs at Cambridge UK): PhD student in EECS at MIT</li>
  <li>Victor Mao (Berkeley): Google, Inc.</li>
  <li>Alon Galor (Brown): DPhil student at Oxford</li>
  <li>Victoria Stevens (Yale): MD-PhD program at Mayo Clinic</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="graduate-students">Graduate Students</h3>

<p>Weâd love to have graduate students rotate!Â Â The student must already be enrolled in a graduate program at Harvard (Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics, Biophysics, Biological and Biomedical Sciences, etc.) or at MIT (Health Sciences &amp; Technology, etc.).</p>

<p>Due to high volume, inquires regarding graduate student positions from those who are in the process of applying to graduate programsÂ will go unanswered.</p>

<p>Visiting graduate positions may be available. There are no internship positions for foreign medical students.</p>

<h3 id="undergraduate-research-assistants">Undergraduate Research Assistants</h3>

<p>A small number of research positionsÂ are open for undergraduates throughout the year, primarily for Harvard and MIT undergraduates. AÂ 10-hour commitment during school year and a full-time commitment during summer are required. Strong quantitative background and substantial programming experience are essential. You may also be interested in the <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/summer-institute-biomedical-informatics">Summer Institute in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics at Harvard-MIT Health, Science and Technology</a>.</p>

<h3 id="software-engineers">Software Engineers</h3>

<p>We are also hiring software engineers interested in using their skills to help build a whole-genome analysis platform for researchers and physicians. Experience in bioinformatics is helpful but not required. International applicants with at least a masterâs degree are welcomed; remote work is a possibility.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="to-the-applicants-to-the-big-phd-program-">To the applicants to the BIG PhD program :</h3>

<p>Many of you are sending me emails with CVs to express your interest in the Bioinformatics &amp; Integrative Genomics PhD program (<a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/big/">http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/big/</a>); some of you are asking to meet with me. IÂ am delighted that you are interested in the program.Â But the admissionÂ decisions are made by the admissions committeeÂ after carefully examining all the application materials (includingÂ recommendation letters, transcripts, test scores, personal statement) submitted via the official application portal (<a href="https://gsas.harvard.edu/admissions">https://gsas.harvard.edu/admissions</a>). Therefore, I do not make judgment on oneâs CV alone and do not comment on anyoneâs chances or provide suggestions.</p>

<p>Please note that the committeeÂ selects our incoming class without regard to a specific advisor with whom the student wishes to work (if the applicant indicates any). Every student is funded for the first two years by the school (including by a grant from NIH), rather than by a specific laboratory, in order to provide an opportunity forÂ the student to explore.Â Therefore, showing an interest in a particular professorâs laboratory in the hopesÂ that the professor would speak on the studentâs behalf is not likely to be helpful for the admissions decisions.</p>

<p>As to the question of whether I am accepting students, the answer is yes, but I do not discuss potential research projects with students until they are admitted. So far,Â I have accepted all BIG students who wished to join my laboratory.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I am unable to respond to individual queriesÂ due to the heavy volume of emails I receive.</p>
